## Key Features

### Adaptive Compression Schemes

MoonBall uses a machine learning model to determine the optimal compression algorithm for each data chunk. It chooses from multiple algorithms such as **Brotli**, **LZMA**, and **Zstandard** (Zstd), depending on the type of data and its compressibility. This results in a highly efficient compression approach tailored specifically to each data type. There are currently 3 Compression Schemes: Fast, Balanced (being the default), and Maximum.

### Chunk-Level Compression

The MoonBall Archiver first indexes and then divides files into logical chunks for independent compression, ensuring that each chunk is handled in the most space-efficient way possible. Chunk-level compression not only improves compression ratios but also enables parallel processing for enhanced speed.

### Comprehensive Graphical User Interface (GUI)

MoonBall includes a user-friendly GUI, implemented in both **Python** and  **Rust** (using **Egui** with **Rust**), allowing even beginners to easily compress and decompress files or directories. This interface provides features like:

- Adding files or directories for compression
- Saving the resulting MoonBall archive
- Extracting compressed archives
- Semantic search

### Machine Learning Enhancements

MoonBall integrates **Transformers.js** (Python FFI in Rust version) to generate embeddings for each file chunk, which enhances the retrieval, clustering, and deduplication of data. These embeddings also enable semantic-based data retrieval and adaptive chunking.

### Integration with AI Tools

MoonBall leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for enhanced data retrieval, clustering, and **semantic-based search**. This utilizes **Transformers** models for file content analysis and embedding generation, allowing users to find files based on context rather than exact filenames, even while the `.mnbl` archive is still compressed.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

The Rust implementation introduces an optional **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** feature for additional security when accessing encrypted archives. This uses OTP (One-Time Password) verification to ensure that only authorized users can extract the contents of an archive.

### Extended Encryption Options

MoonBall supports strong encryption for archives, with options for different algorithms, including **AES-ECB** and **AES-CBC** modes. These encryption features help protect sensitive data stored within MoonBall archives.

### Fun Emoji Extensions

Set the archive file extension (`.mnbl` or `.ðŸŒ•`) in keeping with the spirit of the Moon Programming Language.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

For more advanced users, MoonBall provides a powerful CLI that allows adding files or directories, selecting compression schemes, running semantic-searches, and extracting archives directly from the terminal. The CLI supports enabling encryption, using 2FA, and other advanced options.

### Multi-Platform Compatibility

The MoonBall Archiver is designed with compatibility in mind, providing cross-platform functionality on both Windows and Unix-like systems.

### Extensible Design for Future Development

MoonBall has been designed with extensibility at its core, allowing for future enhancements:

- **Rust Implementation**: A parallel implementation in **Rust** has been created to complement the Python prototype. This Rust version enhances performance, security, and scalability.
- **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)**: To achieve interoperability, MoonBall leverages compression libraries via FFI, integrating with Python-based machine learning tools for tasks like embedding generation.
- **Moon Integration**: Utilizing Moon's standard library modules for file I/O and other basic functionalities to streamline development and make MoonBall a perfect match for the Moon ecosystem.

## How It Works

MoonBall Archiver operates in a structured and efficient sequence to optimize the compression and management of digital data. This process ensures that files are stored in the most space-efficient manner while maintaining easy access and integrity:

### 1. Indexing

**Indexing** is the initial step where MoonBall Archiver creates a structured list of all files and logical chunks within those files. This metadata index acts as the backbone of the archiver, facilitating efficient retrieval and management of archived data.

- **Functionality**: The archiver scans the specified files and directories, recording the structure, size, and other relevant metadata. This data is essential for subsequent steps like chunking and compression.
- **Benefit**: By maintaining a detailed index, MoonBall ensures that data can be quickly located and processed during compression, decompression, and retrieval. The index is stored in a way that it can be easily accessible and quickly updated.

### 2. Chunking

**Chunking** involves dividing each file into smaller, manageable parts, known as **chunks**. Each chunk is processed independently to determine the best compression algorithm and embedding generation method.

- **Functionality**: Files are split into chunks based on predefined criteria, such as size limits. This approach allows for more granular and efficient compression.
- **Benefit**: Chunking reduces the computational overhead by processing smaller data segments and enables parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the compression process. It also helps in adapting compression strategies to the nature of different data types.

### 3. Embeddings and Index Storage

**Embeddings** are numerical representations of each chunk, generated using machine learning models. These embeddings capture the semantic context and content of data, which is crucial for advanced features like semantic search.

- **Functionality**: For each chunk, MoonBall Archiver uses a pre-trained **Transformers** model to generate embeddings. These embeddings are stored alongside the index in the archive.
- **Benefit**: Embeddings enable semantic analysis, data deduplication, and retrieval. They allow the archiver to cluster similar files and provide meaningful search results, even when the content is compressed.

### 4. Compression

**Compression** is the process of reducing the size of each chunk to save storage space. MoonBall Archiver applies different compression algorithms to each chunk based on its type and compressibility.

- **Functionality**: For each chunk, the archiver evaluates several compression algorithmsâ€”such as Brotli, LZMA, and Zstandardâ€”and selects the most suitable one based on machine learning predictions.
- **Benefit**: By choosing the best compression algorithm for each chunk, MoonBall Archiver achieves higher overall compression ratios and better performance.

### 5. Embeddings and Index Storage

After compression, the embeddings and index are stored in the **header** of the MoonBall archive file. This metadata is crucial for efficient data retrieval and management.

- **Functionality**: The index and embeddings are serialized and written to the beginning of the archive file.
- **Benefit**: Storing metadata in the header allows for quick access during retrieval and is essential for features like semantic search, file lookup, and archive validation.

### 6. Checksum Footer

A **checksum** is computed for the index and embedded data to ensure the integrity and consistency of the archive.

- **Functionality**: Using a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256), the archiver generates a checksum of the metadata and attaches it to the end of the archive file.
- **Benefit**: The checksum allows the archiver to verify the integrity of the metadata during extraction, ensuring that the data has not been tampered with or corrupted.

### Example Workflow

To illustrate the process, consider the following example:

1. **Indexing**: The user adds a directory containing a project with multiple files (e.g., source code, images, and documentation).
2. **Chunking**: The archiver splits the files into chunks. For example, source code files might be split into 5MB chunks.
3. **Embeddings**: For each chunk, embeddings are generated using a Transformers model like **distilbert-base-uncased**. These embeddings capture the context and meaning of the data.
4. **Compression**: Each chunk is compressed using an optimal algorithm. For instance, text-based chunks might use Zstandard, while image chunks might use Brotli.
5. **Storage**: The embeddings and index are stored in the header of the archive file, along with the compressed chunks.
6. **Checksum**: A checksum is generated and stored in the footer to ensure the archive's integrity.

This structured approach ensures that MoonBall Archiver is highly efficient, adaptable, and reliable, making it the future of digital archiving.
