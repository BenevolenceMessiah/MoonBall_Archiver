## Key Features

### Adaptive Compression Schemes

MoonBall uses a machine learning model to determine the optimal compression algorithm for each data chunk. It chooses from multiple algorithms such as **Brotli**, **LZMA**, and **Zstandard** (Zstd), depending on the type of data and its compressibility. This results in a highly efficient compression approach tailored specifically to each data type. There are currently 3 Compression Schemes: Fast, Balanced (being the default), and Maximum.

### Chunk-Level Compression

The MoonBall Archiver first indexes and then divides files into logical chunks for independent compression, ensuring that each chunk is handled in the most space-efficient way possible. Chunk-level compression not only improves compression ratios but also enables parallel processing for enhanced speed.

### Comprehensive Graphical User Interface (GUI)

MoonBall includes a user-friendly GUI, implemented in **Rust** using **Egui**, allowing even beginners to easily compress and decompress files or directories. This interface provides features like:

- Adding files or directories for compression
- Saving the resulting MoonBall archive
- Extracting compressed archives
- Semantic search

### Machine Learning Enhancements

MoonBall integrates **Transformers.js** (Python FFI in Rust version) to generate embeddings for each file chunk, which enhances the retrieval, clustering, and deduplication of data. These embeddings also enable semantic-based data retrieval and adaptive chunking.

### Integration with AI Tools

MoonBall leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for enhanced data retrieval, clustering, and **semantic-based search**. This utilizes **Transformers** models for file content analysis and embedding generation, allowing users to find files based on context rather than exact filenames, even while the `.mnbl` archive is still compressed.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

The Rust implementation introduces an optional **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** feature for additional security when accessing encrypted archives. This uses OTP (One-Time Password) verification to ensure that only authorized users can extract the contents of an archive.

### Extended Encryption Options

MoonBall supports strong encryption for archives, with options for different algorithms, including **AES-ECB** and **AES-CBC** modes. These encryption features help protect sensitive data stored within MoonBall archives.

### Fun Emoji Extensions

Set the archive file extension (`.mnbl` or `.ðŸŒ•`) in keeping with the spirit of the Moon Programming Language.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

For more advanced users, MoonBall provides a powerful CLI that allows adding files or directories, selecting compression schemes, running semantic-searches, and extracting archives directly from the terminal. The CLI supports enabling encryption, using 2FA, and other advanced options.

### Multi-Platform Compatibility

The MoonBall Archiver is designed with compatibility in mind, providing cross-platform functionality on both Windows and Unix-like systems.

### Extensible Design for Future Development

MoonBall has been designed with extensibility at its core, allowing for future enhancements:

- **Rust Implementation**: A parallel implementation in **Rust** has been created to complement the Python prototype. This Rust version enhances performance, security, and scalability.
- **Foreign Function Interface (FFI)**: To achieve interoperability, MoonBall leverages compression libraries via FFI, integrating with Python-based machine learning tools for tasks like embedding generation.
- **Moon Integration**: Utilizing Moon's standard library modules for file I/O and other basic functionalities to streamline development and make MoonBall a perfect match for the Moon ecosystem.

With its RAG-based retrieval system, MoonBall provides the potential for **semantic-based search** in future versions. A user could search for files based on context or descriptions instead of specific filenames, revolutionizing data accessibility.

### Scenario 4: Secure Extraction with 2FA

A user wants to protect their archive from unauthorized access. They enable **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** when creating the archive. To extract the files, the user must enter a valid One-Time Password (OTP) to proceed, ensuring the safety of their sensitive data.

## Further Expansion

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for Archive Access

In future versions, we plan to implement **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** for enhanced security when accessing encrypted MoonBall archives. This will provide an additional layer of protection for sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized users can access the content.

### Rust-Based Implementation

In future versions, MoonBall will implement a parallel version in **Rust** to provide enhanced performance. Rust's memory safety and concurrency capabilities would allow us to mix and match Python and Rust libraries for even greater efficiency in compression and archiving.

### Interoperability with Moon

- Leveraging existing compression libraries via FFI is essential for integrating MoonBall's features into the **Moon Programming Language**. This will allow users of Moon to interact with MoonBall seamlessly, leveraging Moon's capabilities for future AI integration.
- Utilizing Moonâ€™s standard library for file I/O and other basic functionalities will help streamline further development and make MoonBall a perfect match for the Moon ecosystem.
